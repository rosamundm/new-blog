    I'm Rosamund, a tech and humanities professional living in Berlin.

        After earning a BA in French & German from the University of Leicester, I began my career as a translator, editor, 
        and copywriter. However, I'd always wanted to explore what really went on behind the websites and apps that 
        I was selling with my words, and I knew my way around many a CMS. I started teaching myself to code and a
        few years down the line became a software developer.

        I don't see my professional interests as especially disparate. When I write, whether it's code or prose, it's 
        fuelled by a fascination with syntax and semantics, as well as an obsession with getting to the bottom of something,
        whatever the context may be. More characteristics shared by these professions, in my view, are systems thinking and 
        problem-solving, along with a hearty dash of creativity.

        My passions are books and cities, which you'll find reflected in my personal web projects. Editorial tasks may not
        form the core of my professional duties anymore, but I certainly make good use of those skills in my research and writing.

        Some writing I'm proud of has been published in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/brexit-europe-young-people-expats">Guardian</a>,
        <a href="https://www.elsewhere-journal.com/blog/2017/1/20/return-to-lakenheath-suffolk-england">Elsewhere Journal</a>, and <a href="https://queenmobs.com/2016/10/22203/">Queen Mob's Tea House</a>.
        I have written an as-yet unpublished novel set in Quebec, where I had a short stint between graduation 
        and Berlin. I am also working on an experimental memoir.
